I was unfortunately unable to access many of the profile pictures that are supposed to be next
to the tweets, due to the fact that most the image URLs included in the JSON file were unusable.

I used jQuery's built in show and hide functions to smoothly remove and display the tweets and
hashtags, and I used setInterval to display a new tweet every 3 seconds. In addition, I used 
setTimeout to delay the hashtags ticker and desync the two tickers. To allow for a continuous, 
uninterrupted stream of tweets and hashtags, I moved each element to the end of the unordered
list as it was removed.
