I used POST to post the geolocation data to the OpenWeatherApp API, and GET to 
get the JSON data. In the GET function, I appended a string containing the JSON
data and html elements to the preexisting div with the id "weather". I decided 
to add the bootstrap classes using jQuery because I could not implement 
them in my own css file, as they came from a separate file included with the 
bootstrap package.
